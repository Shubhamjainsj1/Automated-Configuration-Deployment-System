The project aimed to : 
• Developed a Python-based tool to automate configuration file generation and deployment across environments using
predefined YAML templates.
• Integrated Git version control to manage configuration states and ensure rollback support in case of faulty
deployments.
• Reduced manual configuration errors by 40% and improved deployment consistency across dev, staging, and
production.
